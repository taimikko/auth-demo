# Authentication Demo #

Simple authentication demo. Made with Node, Express, Pug, Passport and mongoose.

## Use ##

For this demo to work, you must have your MongoDB running. In this example
I did use *auth-demo* as my database name and *users* as the collection
name. You might need to change the connection string in the user.js model file.


## WARNING ##

Do not use in production. Password is saved in plain-text and the validation is
basically useless. This is just a demo to test how the Passport middleware works.
